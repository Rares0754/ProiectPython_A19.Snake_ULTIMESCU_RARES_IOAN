Product Price Crawler
Phase 1 - Basic product price retrieval

Develop a Python script that takes a list of products, searches compari.ro, and collects price information.

  [-] Input list of product names
  [-] Fetch product listings from compari.ro
  [-] Extract product name, lowest price, highest price, and number of offers

Functional result: Script outputs accurate price information for each product in a structured format.
Phase 2 - JSON export and structured storage

Enhance the script to save the collected product data in a JSON file for easy use and further processing.

  [-] Convert collected product data into JSON format
  [-] Save JSON to a file with proper structure
  [-] Ensure all products have complete information recorded

Functional result: Script generates a JSON file containing all products with their price data and offer counts.
